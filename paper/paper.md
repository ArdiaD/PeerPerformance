# Summary

`PeerPerformance` is an R package (@R) for the peer--performance evaluation of financial investments with luck--correction. In 
particular, it implements the peer performance ratios of @ArdiaBoudt2016 which measure the percentage of peers 
a focal (hedge) fund outperforms and underperforms, after correction for luck. It is useful for fund or portfolio managers to 
benchmark their investments or screen a universe of new funds. In addition, it implements the testing framework for the Sharpe 
and modified Sharpe ratios, described in @LedoitWolf2008 and @ArdiaBoudt2015. The latest version of the package
is available at 'https://github.com/ArdiaD/PeerPerformance'.
