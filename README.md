# PeerPerformance

`PeerPerformance` is an R package for the peer-performance evaluation of financial investments with
luck-correction. In particular, it implements the peer performance ratios 
of [Ardia and Boudt (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2017.10.014) which measure the percentage of peers a focal fund outperforms and underperforms, after
correction for luck. It is useful for fund or portfolio managers to 
benchmark their investments or screen a universe of new funds. 
In addition, it implements the testing framework for the Sharpe and modified Sharpe ratios, described 
in [Ledoit and Wolf (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jempfin.2008.03.002) 
and [Ardia and Boudt (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2015.02.008).
