Function which performs the screening of a universe of returns, and
computes the Sharpe outperformance ratio.

\details{
The Sharpe ratio (Sharpe 1992) is one industry standard for measuring the
absolute risk adjusted performance of hedge funds. We propose to complement
the Sharpe ratio with the fund's outperformance ratio, defined as the
percentage number of funds that have a significantly lower Sharpe ratio. In
a pairwise testing framework, a fund can have a significantly higher Sharpe
ratio because of luck. We correct for this by applying the false discovery
rate approach by Storey (2002).

For the testing, only the intersection of non-\code{NA} observations for the
two funds are used.

The methodology proceeds as follows:
\itemize{
\item (1) compute all
pairwise tests of Sharpe differences using the bootstrap approach of Ledoit
and Wolf (2002). This means that for a universe of \eqn{N} funds, we perform
\eqn{N(N-1)/2}{N*(N-1)/2} tests. The algorithm has been parallelized and the
computational burden can be split across several cores. The number of cores
can be defined in \code{control}, see below.
\item (2) for each fund, the
false discovery rate approach by Storey (2002) is used to determine the
proportions over, equal, and underperforming funds, in terms of Sharpe ratio,
in the database.
}
The argument \code{control} is a list that can supply any of the following
components:
\itemize{
\item \code{'type'} Asymptotic approach (\code{type = 1}) or
studentized circular bootstrap approach (\code{type = 2}). Default:
\code{type = 1}.
\item \code{'ttype'} Test based on ratio (\code{type = 1})
or product (\code{type = 2}). Default: \code{type = 2}.
\item \code{'hac'} Heteroscedastic-autocorrelation consistent standard
errors. Default: \code{hac = FALSE}.
\item \code{'nBoot'} Number of bootstrap replications for computing the p-value. Default: \code{nBoot =
499}.
\item \code{'bBoot'} Block length in the circular bootstrap. Default:
\code{bBoot = 1}, i.e. iid bootstrap. \code{bBoot = 0} uses optimal
block-length.
\item \code{'pBoot'} Symmetric p-value (\code{pBoot = 1}) or
asymmetric p-value (\code{pBoot = 2}). Default: \code{pBoot = 1}.
\item \code{'nCore'} Number of cores to be used. Default: \code{nCore = 1}.
\item \code{'minObs'} Minimum number of concordant observations to compute
the ratios. Default: \code{minObs = 10}.
\item \code{'minObsPi'} Minimum
number of observations to compute pi0. Default: \code{minObsPi = 1}.
\item \code{'lambda'} Threshold value to compute pi0. Default: \code{lambda
= NULL}, i.e. data driven choice.

\note{
Further details on the methodology with an application to the hedge
fund industry is given in in Ardia and Boudt (2018).

Some internal functions where adapted from Michael Wolf MATLAB code.

Application of the false discovery rate approach applied to the mutual fund
industry has been presented in Barraz, Scaillet and Wermers (2010).
